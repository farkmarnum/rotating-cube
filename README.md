# notes

- figure out where the vertexes are
- figure out where the lines are
- project the camera

how do you draw a line on a pixel grid?

NOTE:
- "pixel" coordinates are integers, `0` to `WIDTH-1` and `0` to `HEIGHT-1`
  `px, py`
- "point" coordinates are floats, `0.0` to `1.0`
  `x, y`
- "vertex" coordinates are floats, unbounded
  `vx, vy`
